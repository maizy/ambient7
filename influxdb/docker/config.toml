### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  dir = "/data/meta"
  hostname = "localhost"

  leader-lease-timeout = "500ms"
  commit-timeout = "50ms"

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  dir = "/data/db"

  # The following WAL settings are for the b1 storage engine used in 0.9.2. They won't
  # apply to any new shards created after upgrading to a version > 0.9.3.
  max-wal-size = 104857600 # Maximum size the WAL can reach before a flush. Defaults to 100MB.
  wal-flush-interval = "10m0s" # Maximum time data can sit in WAL before a flush.
  wal-partition-flush-delay = "2s" # The delay time between each WAL partition being flushed.

  # These are the WAL settings for the storage engine >= 0.9.3

  wal-enable-logging = true

  # When a series in the WAL in-memory cache reaches this size in bytes it is marked as ready to
  # flush to the index
  # wal-ready-series-size = 25600

  # Flush and compact a partition once this ratio of series are over the ready size
  # wal-compaction-threshold = 0.6

  # Force a flush and compaction if any series in a partition gets above this size in bytes
  # wal-max-series-size = 2097152

  # Force a flush of all series and full compaction if there have been no writes in this
  # amount of time. This is useful for ensuring that shards that are cold for writes don't
  # keep a bunch of data cached in memory and in the WAL.
  # wal-flush-cold-interval = "10m"

  # Force a partition to flush its largest series if it reaches this approximate size in
  # bytes. Remember there are 5 partitions so you'll need at least 5x this amount of memory.
  # The more memory you have, the bigger this can be.
  # wal-partition-size-threshold = 20971520
